Hi There,
My name is Xavier and I am a future aspiring software developer. My passion for software came from creating unity projects when I was younger and the excitement
I got from creating a piece of code which I was proud of. I now study at AUT doing second-year Software Development and am looking to pursue an internship over the summer

I have experience coding in Java, SQL, C and HTML.
My proudest achievements as a software developer were creating an RPG Game, Maze Game and Virus Simulation. I created these games in Java and encountered alot of errors 
along the way but was very proud of what the final product of my work became.
