Hi There,
My name is Xavier and I am a future aspiring software developer. I really enjoy programming in languages such as Java and C. Aswell as these languages I have a great interest in data-structures and software development.
I have experience coding in Java, SQL, C and HTML.
My proudest achievements as a software developer were creating an RPG Game, Maze Game and Virus Simulation. I created these games in Java and encountered alot of errors 
along the way but was very proud of what the final product of my work became.
